## Namaka — Telegram

Chat with your Namaka agent from Telegram. The bridge is a thin client: it forwards messages to the same HTTP server as the CLI and web app (`channel: "telegram"`).

### Setup

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token.
2. Ensure the Namaka server is configured (`~/.nakama/config.ini` or env API keys).
3. Open **Integrations → Telegram** in the web dashboard, save your bot token and profile, and copy the **pairing code**.
4. Run `bun run dev:telegram`, message your bot, and paste the pairing code once. Settings are stored in `~/.nakama/telegram/config.ini`.

### Run

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run dev:telegram
```

The bridge auto-starts the server if it is not already running (same as the CLI).

Optional env vars:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — bot token (instead of the config file)
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` — skip pairing for specific numeric user IDs
- `NAKAMA_TELEGRAM_PROFILE_ID` — bot profile (default `default`)
- `NAKAMA_SERVER_URL` — server base URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:4310`)
- `NAKAMA_WEB_PUBLIC_URL` — public web app URL for Composio OAuth links sent in chat (e.g. `https://nakama.example.com`)

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Welcome message (also used when opening the bot) |
| `/help` | List commands |
| `/stop` | Stop the current reply while it is still generating |
| `/clear` | Clear chat history |
| `/compact` | Compact conversation history |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/org` | Choose or switch organization |
| `/profile` | Choose or switch bot profile |
| `/status` | Server and model status |

Send plain text, a photo (optional caption), or a document (pdf, docx, txt, csv — max 5 MB) to chat with the agent.

**Stopping a reply:** While the bot is working on an answer, send `/stop`. Any text already generated is sent first, then the bot replies `Stopped.`. If nothing is in progress, you get `Nothing to stop.`

New users must paste a one-time pairing code from Integrations → Telegram in a **private chat** with the bot (unless pre-approved via allowed user IDs in Advanced settings).

### Group chats

1. Link your account in a private chat with the bot first (pairing code).
2. In `@BotFather`, open your bot settings and disable **Group Privacy** if you want `@mention` triggers to work reliably.
3. If you changed Group Privacy, remove the bot from the group and add it back so Telegram applies the new setting.
4. Add the bot to a Telegram group.
5. Trigger it with an @mention, a reply to one of its messages, or a slash command (e.g. `/status`).

Each group shares one conversation history and one org/profile selection (`/org` and `/profile` apply to the whole group). Pairing codes cannot be used in groups.

Telegram’s default **Group Privacy** limits what group messages reach the bot. Nakama still applies its own local filter, so even with privacy disabled it only responds when the message is a slash command, a reply to the bot, or a real bot mention.

Session mapping is stored in `~/.nakama/telegram/chat-sessions.json`.

Replies are tuned for chat UX: the agent uses Telegram-specific prompting, preserves rich text formatting such as emphasis, code, and links, shows a typing indicator while working, and may split longer answers into several short messages.
