description: Archive or clean up facts from active MEMORY.md into memory-archive/ without deleting them. Use when the user wants to forget, remove, tidy old memory, or free space for new memories.

Use this skill when the user wants to remove facts from active memory without deleting them permanently.

- Use the `update-profile-memory` skill to **add** facts to active `MEMORY.md`.
- Use profile skills for repeatable procedures — not for archiving memory.
- Archived facts live under `memory-archive/` and are **not** loaded into chat automatically. Use `search_files` or `read_file` to retrieve them later.

## MEMORY.md shape

Active memory is `MEMORY.md` in the profile workspace:

- A preamble (`# Memory Log` and `---`) must stay intact.
- Facts are bullets under dated sections: `## YYYY-MM-DD` followed by `- bullet text`.

Copy bullet text **verbatim** from `read_file` output when editing. Do not paraphrase.

## Archive file shape

Archive files live at `memory-archive/YYYY-MM.md` (year and month of the archive action, UTC).

New archive file template:

```markdown
# Archived Memory

---
```

Each archive append starts with metadata comments, then the archived sections:

```markdown
<!-- archived: 2026-07-12T10:30:00.000Z -->
<!-- reason: user asked to forget old job details -->

## 2026-06-29

- Old preference.
```

Preserve each bullet's original `## YYYY-MM-DD` section header from `MEMORY.md`.

## Workflow

1. `read_file` `MEMORY.md` and identify the exact `- bullet` lines to archive.
2. Confirm targets with the user when the request is ambiguous.
3. Choose `memory-archive/{YYYY-MM}.md` for the current month.
4. Check whether the archive file exists **before** calling `read_file`. With `bash`, run `if test -f memory-archive/{YYYY-MM}.md; then printf 'exists\n'; else printf 'missing\n'; fi` in the active profile workspace, replacing `{YYYY-MM}` with the chosen month. A missing file (or missing `memory-archive/` directory) is normal for the first archive:
   - If the result is `exists`, `read_file` the archive to preserve its contents.
   - If the result is `missing`, skip the read and create the archive in step 5.
   - If `bash` is unavailable, use `read_file`; treat only a file-not-found result as a new archive. Stop on permission or other errors rather than overwriting an unread archive.
5. **Append to the archive first** (reduces data-loss risk):
   - If the file does not exist, `write_file` with the template plus the append block.
   - If it exists, `edit_file` to append after the existing content (or `write_file` the full merged content).
6. `edit_file` `MEMORY.md` to remove each archived `- bullet` line.
7. Remove any `## YYYY-MM-DD` section that has no bullets left.
8. Re-read `MEMORY.md` and the archive file to verify the result.
9. If archiving was to free space for new memories, confirm `MEMORY.md` is under 4096 bytes before retrying with `update-profile-memory`.

When `edit_file` reports a missing, duplicate, or overlapping match, `read_file` again and issue a corrected edit with exact text.

## Legacy layout

If you find archives under `data/memory-archive/` instead of `memory-archive/`, use the top-level `memory-archive/` path for new writes.
