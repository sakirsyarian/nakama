description: Save or move durable outputs (reports, slide decks, HTML, summaries, code snippets, logs) under artifacts/ for the dashboard Artifacts tab. Use when the user asks to save, move, or keep something as an artifact beyond the chat session.

Use this skill to save **durable deliverables** the user may revisit later.

- Use `artifacts/{filename}` paths relative to the profile workspace (e.g. `artifacts/report.md`).
- Do **not** save soul files (`SOUL.md`, `STYLE.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`), `MEMORY.md`, or knowledge-base uploads here — those have their own locations and workflows.
- This workflow is **text-only**. Images, PDFs, and other binary files are not supported here.

## When to use

- Reports, summaries, generated code snippets, logs, or structured notes the user asked to keep
- Outputs they may download or review later in the profile **Artifacts** tab

## Metadata sidecar

After writing the artifact file, write a JSON sidecar at `artifacts/{filename}.nakama-meta.json` so the dashboard shows the correct MIME type and timestamp.

Example for `artifacts/report.md`:

```json
{
  "mimeType": "text/markdown",
  "savedAt": "2026-07-12T05:13:00.000Z",
  "sizeBytes": 1234
}
```

- `mimeType`: choose an accurate type (`text/markdown`, `text/plain`, `application/json`, `text/html`, etc.)
- `savedAt`: current time in ISO 8601 UTC
- `sizeBytes`: UTF-8 byte length of the artifact file content (not the sidecar)

## Workflow

1. Choose a short, descriptive filename under `artifacts/` (use subdirectories when grouping related files, e.g. `artifacts/weekly/report.md`).
2. `write_file` the artifact content to `artifacts/{filename}`. If that name already exists, a date suffix is added automatically (e.g. `report-2026-07-14.md`).
3. `write_file` the metadata sidecar to `artifacts/{filename}.nakama-meta.json` using the same base filename from step 2.
4. Confirm both paths in your reply so the user knows where to find the file. On web chat, saved artifacts also appear as attachment chips on the assistant message (with preview) in addition to the profile **Artifacts** tab.

## Revising an existing artifact

The user may have edited the file in the chat preview panel. Chat history shows the original `write_file` content, which can be stale.

1. `read_file` the current path (do not rewrite from memory or earlier tool output).
2. `edit_file` the **same path** with the requested changes.
3. Do **not** `delete_file` an artifact to “replace” it. Chat chips keep pointing at the original path; deleting it makes earlier messages unopenable. `write_file` to an existing name creates a new dated file and leaves the original.

## MIME type guidance

| Content | mimeType |
|---------|----------|
| Markdown | `text/markdown` |
| Plain text / logs | `text/plain` |
| JSON | `application/json` |
| HTML | `text/html` |
| Source code | `text/plain` or a specific `text/x-*` when obvious |
