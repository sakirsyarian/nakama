/**
 * Fetching the optimiser binary at runtime, for instances already running.
 *
 * The image can carry it (`docker build --build-arg OMNI_VERSION=`), and by
 * default it does. An instance already deployed cannot be talked into a rebuild,
 * so the toggle in the dashboard would switch on something that is not there and
 * the panel would report it missing with no way forward. This closes that one
 * gap and does nothing else.
 *
 * What the checksum buys, stated plainly: SHA256SUMS is fetched from the same
 * release as the archive, so it catches a truncated or corrupted download. It is
 * not a defence against a compromised release, because an attacker who can
 * replace one asset can replace both. Operators who need more than that set
 * `NAKAMA_OMNI_AUTO_INSTALL=0` and build the image with the binary instead.
